### Add check to VCF load to confirm all mapped to same reference
### Add check that target Fasta contigs are the same as VCF reference
### Allow to have genotypes inferred from the metadata column. I.e. instead of specifying ST11, ST15, etc, just take each ST to be a distinct genotype
### Check that VCFs were mapped to the same reference.
### Need to add check that species SNPs don't overlap with genotype SNPs
